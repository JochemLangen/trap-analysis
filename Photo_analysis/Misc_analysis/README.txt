*** Miscellaneous analysis overview ***

The files in this folder provide programmes that can be used for supplementary analysis.
It contains:

- Bessel analysis: a file to plot and investigate the bessel region of a light beam.
- camera analysis: a file used to analyse the results from a camera to look into its linearity.
- camera analysis paper: a more up-to-date version of the camera analysis file that uses measurements of sheets of paper to look into the linearity of the measured intensity w.r.t. the exposure time.
- Gaussian analysis: a file used to analyse and characterise a measured gaussian beam.
- Gaussian analysis new: the next version of the gaussian analysis file.
- iris image: a programme used for the investigation into the optimum radius of an iris that is placed within the hollow beam optical axis.
- scale intensity: this file allows the manual scaling of image intensities to compare images and verify correct scaling and exposures.
