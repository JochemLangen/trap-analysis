** Overview of power analysis documents **

These files provide analysis tools to process power measurements using a knife edge method of a gaussian beam.

File overview:
-beam power meas: this file provides analysis of power measurements over time.
-Beam analysis: this file provides analysis and characterisation of a gaussian beam using the knife edge method.
-2D beam analysis: this file provides analysis and characterisation of the propagation of a gaussian beam from data obtained using the knife edge method. 
These tools may also be implemented with image analysis (see the gaussian image analysis in the photo analysis folder).
