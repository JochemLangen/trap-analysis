*** Putting ultracold atoms and molecules in a box: software ***

This is the github page containing the project report as well as all the software that has been developed during the project and the data used.
The photo analysis folder contains the programmes that can be used for the analysis of ring profiles.
The power analysis folder contains the programmes that can be used for the analysis of gaussian profile power measurements using a knife edge method.
The simulations folder contains the files and programmes relevant to the simulations of lens and axicon light propagation.

These files can be used in the development of box traps based on the conclusions presented in the report. 
The simulations can be utilised to test the set-up in advance to as a proof of concept and the photo analysis tools can help in the set-up process and can be used to characterise the trap or compare it quantitatively to others.
